## Context

In our current CLI, we need to pass the parameters to the CLI. It's not easy to use. We need to add a config file to the CLI.

We need to config a lot of things, like (Generate by GitHub Copilot):

- the server url
- the language
- the features
- the output
- the path
- ...

But, for the user, it will be hard to remember all the parameters. So we need to add a config file to the CLI.
