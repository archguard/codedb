### A Metrics Suite for Object-Oriented Design

- **Number of Methods (NOM)**. Number of methods in a class.
- **Weighted Methods Per Class (WMC)**. Sum of McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity [25] for each method in the class.
- **Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO)**. The number of classes a class depends upon. It counts classes used from
  both external libraries as well as classes from the project.
- **Response for a Class (RFC)**. The number of methods that can be directly called by a client.
- **Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM)**. The number of pairs of methods in a class that do not access the same set of
  instance variables.

### SATT: Tailoring Code Metric Thresholds for Different Software Architectures

2016 年，43 引用

Abstract

> 代码度量分析是一种众所周知的评估软件系统质量的方法。 然而，当前的工具和技术并未考虑系统架构（例如 MVC、Android）。
> 这意味着所有 Class 的评估都是相似的，无论他们的具体职责如何。 在本文中，我们提出了
> SATT（软件架构定制阈值），一种检测架构角色(architectural role)
> 在代码度量方面是否与系统中的其他角色有很大不同的方法，并为该角色提供特定的阈值。
> 我们在 400 多个项目中评估了我们在 2 种不同架构（MVC 和 Android）上的方法。 我们还采访了 6 位专家，以解释为什么某些架构角色与其他角色不同。
> 我们的结果表明，SATT 可以克服传统方法存在的问题，尤其是当某些架构角色呈现出于其他角色截然不同的度量值时。

Spring: Controller-Services-Repository-Entity-Component

Android: Activity-Fragment-AsyncTask or Activity-ViewModel-Repository-Entity-Component

SATT 指标：

- **Dataset creation**. We select systems that follow the analyzed architecture, e.g., Spring MVC applications. We
  perform this step only once and use the same benchmark to calculate the thresholds for all other architectural roles.
- **Architectural roles extraction**. We identify each class’ architectural role in the benchmark. In case of Spring
  MVC, CONTROLLER classes are always annotated with @Controller.
- **Metrics calculation**. We calculate code metrics for all classes in the benchmark, regardless of their architectural
  role. In this example, the McCabe number of all classes.
- **Statistical measurement**. We perform a statistical test to measure the difference between the code metric values in
  that architectural role (group 1) and the other classes (group 2). As metric values distributions tend not to fol- low
  a normal distribution (discussed in Section VII), we suggest the use of non-paired Wilcoxon test and Cliff’s Delta
  between the two groups. Bonferroni correction should be applied, as the approach is performed for all combinations of
  architectural roles and code metrics.
- **Analysis of the statistical tests**. If the difference is significant and the effect size ranges from medium to
  large, we continue the approach. Otherwise, we stop. We use Romano et al.’s [30] classification to describe the
  effect. Supposing D as the effect size, ranging from -1 to 1, |D|<0.147 means “negligible effect", |D|<0.33 means
  “small effect", |D|<0.474 means “medium effect", and |D|>=0.474 means “large effect".
- **Weight ratio calculation**. From now on, we only look to the classes of the analyzed architectural role. Following
  the original approach, we use lines of code (LOC) as a weight of all classes. Thus, we calculate LOC for all classes
  and normalize it for all classes that belong to that architectural role in the benchmark. Normalization ensures that
  the sum of all weights will be 100%. In the example, suppose that our benchmark contains 100,000 lines of code in
  CONTROLLER classes, and a class A with 100 lines of code. Thus, A’s weight is 0.001.
- **Weight ratio aggregation**. We order classes according to their metric values in an ascending way. For each class,
  we aggregate the weights by summing up all the weights from classes that have smaller metric values, i.e., classes
  that are above the current class.
- **Thresholds derivation**. We extract the code metric value from the class that has its weight aggregation closest to
  70% (moderate), 80% (high), and 90% (very high).

### Automatic metric thresholds derivation for code smell detection

> 代码异味是代码中设计缺陷的原型，可能会在维护期间引起问题。一种已知的检测代码异味的方法是通过检测规则：不同的面向对象的度量与预定义的阈值的组合。
> 使用这种方法时使用不适当的阈值可能导致观察结果太少（假阴性太多）或观察结果太多（假阳性太多）。此外，如果没有明确的阈值推导方法，则只能使用文献
> （或工具供应商）中建议的方法，这可能不一定适合分析环境。在本文中，我们提出了一种数据驱动（即基于基准）的方法来导出代码度量的阈值，
> 该方法可用于实现代码异味的检测规则。我们的方法是透明的、可重复的，并且能够提取尊重相关度量的统计属性（例如规模和分布）的阈值。因此，
> 我们的方法通过选择相关系统作为基准数据来校准代码坏味道检测规则。为了说明我们的方法，我们基于 Qualitas 语料库的 74
> 个系统生成了一个基准数据集， 提取了五个坏味道检测规则的阈值。
