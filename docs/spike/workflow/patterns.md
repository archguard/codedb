In process-aware information systems various perspectives can be distinguished. The [control-flow perspective](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/index.php)
captures aspects related to control-flow dependencies between various tasks (e.g. parallelism, choice, synchronization etc). 
Originally twenty patterns were proposed for this perspective, but in the latest iteration this has grown to over forty patterns.
The [data perspective](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/data/index.php) deals with the passing of information , 
scoping of variables, etc, while the [resource perspective](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/resource/index.php) deals with resource
to task allocation, delegation, etc. Finally the patterns for the [exception handling perspective](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/exception/index.php)
deal with the various causes of exceptions and the various actions that need to be taken as a result of exceptions occurring.

Process data extracted from information systems for the purpose of process analysis needs to be of high data-quality for 
analysis results to be accurate and trustworthy. [Event Log Imperfection](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/logimperfection/index.php) 
patterns capture some frequently occurring data quality issues that commonly found in event log data used for process analysis.
