# GLR Coding Labels

Source: https://github.com/xJREB/research-microservices-evolvability-glr/blob/master/coding-labels.md

These are all labels used in the coding of the GLR resources.
Since they were based on a previous [interview study on the same topic](https://github.com/xJREB/research-microservices-evolvability-interviews), not all labels that are listed here have been used in the GLR.
Newly formed labels are listed in *italic*.
The coding system is organized in five different categories.
